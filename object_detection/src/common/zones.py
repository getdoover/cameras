"""Detection zones as a spatial filter over what the models found.

The camera app owns the zone editor and hands the zones that concern this app along with
each snapshot (its ``detection_zones`` payload key). A zone names what it wants in its
``detectors`` list — ``ppe``, ``anpr``, or both — independently of its ``kind``, which
describes how the *camera* triggers it and is none of our business.

Why a filter and not a crop: the models run over the whole frame regardless. Cropping to
the zone first would be cheaper, but a person standing half out of the zone would be cut in
two and a plate at the boundary lost outright, and the models are much worse on partial
subjects. So the frame is analysed whole and each finding is then asked which zone it fell
in — which also means one inference run serves any number of zones.

Zone geometry is normalised (0..1, origin top-left) because that is what the frontend
drew and what the camera app stores; model detections are in **original image pixels**
(see ``yolo.Detection``). Bridging those two is this module's job and the reason
:func:`match` needs the frame size.

Deliberately free of doover coupling, like everything else in ``common``: plain dicts and
tuples in, plain objects out, so the device app and the Lambda processor share it verbatim.
