"""Hard-hat / high-vis compliance from a PPE object-detection model.

The model detects *equipment*, not compliance. It emits independent boxes for
`person`, `hardhat`, `no-hardhat`, `safety vest` and `no-safety vest`, and it is
this module's job to decide what that means per person.

Two things make that non-trivial:

* The `no-*` classes are unreliable on their own. A model will happily emit both a
  `hardhat` and a `no-hardhat` box over the same head at similar confidence. So a
  person is treated as compliant if a *positive* box matches them, and only flagged
  when no positive box does -- the `no-*` boxes are used as corroboration and to
  catch people the `person` class missed, never as the sole basis for a violation.
* Equipment boxes have to be attributed to a person. IoU is the wrong measure: a
  hard hat is a tiny box inside a large person box, so their IoU is near zero even
  when they obviously belong together. What matters is how much of the *equipment*
  box falls inside the person box, which is what :func:`_containment` measures.
