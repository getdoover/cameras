"""Fetch and prepare the ONNX weights this app ships.

Run on a dev machine, not the device -- exporting a YOLO .pt needs ultralytics and
torch, which never get installed into the device image. The resulting .onnx files in
models/ are committed so the image build (and a device with no internet) doesn't
depend on Hugging Face being reachable.

Weights and licences
--------------------
* PPE (models/ppe.onnx) -- Hansung-Cho/yolov8-ppe-detection, MIT. 10 classes; we use
  person / hardhat / no-hardhat / safety vest / no-safety vest. Published as a .pt,
  so it gets exported to ONNX here.

  Picked over the two obvious alternatives by measuring all three, at conf=0.3, on
  four images from keremberke/construction-safety-object-detection plus one real
  frame from a site camera:

    model                          ds0  ds1  ds2  ds3   real frame
    Hansung-Cho (MIT)               4    3    1    6    person found
    leeyunjai/yolo11-ppe            4    0    0    3    nothing
    baskarmother (MIT)              1    1    1    1    nothing

  Only Hansung-Cho reliably emits `Person` boxes at all -- baskarmother returned a
  single box per image and never found a person, which makes per-person compliance
  impossible. Don't swap the weights without re-running that comparison: this app's
  whole output depends on people being detected, not just equipment.
* Plate detection (models/plate.onnx) -- morsetechlab/yolov11-license-plate-detection,
  AGPL-3.0. Ships ONNX directly, so it's a straight download.
* Plate OCR (models/plate_ocr.onnx + .yaml) -- ankandrew's fast-plate-ocr
  `cct-xs-v1-global-model`, MIT. Copied out of its hub cache and committed, because
  the library resolves that cache from `Path.home()` with no env override: Lambda sets
  HOME=/tmp, so weights baked into /root/.cache are invisible there and OCR silently
  degrades to detect-but-never-read. Loading by explicit path fixes that.

NOTE the plate detector is AGPL-3.0 while this repo is Apache-2.0. That is a
deliberate, reviewable choice mirroring cattle-cam (which ships AGPL YOLO weights) --
but if this app is ever distributed as a binary to a third party rather than run as
a service, swap it for a permissively-licensed plate detector.
